# Kickoff-Boost-Manager
Kickoff Boost Manager is a BakkesMod plugin inspired by Lethamyr's video “Rocket League NEVER makes balance changes... so I did”. It enhances kickoff gameplay by automatically setting players' boost levels to a customizable percentage at the start of each round. With easy-to-use settings, players can enable or disable the boost adjustment and fine-tune the boost amount. This plugin ensures smoother kickoffs, promotes balanced play, and provides additional customization options for casual or competitive matches.
